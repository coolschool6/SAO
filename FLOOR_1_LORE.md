### Lore Notes

**Grath Legend**: Perhaps Kayaba had a sick sense of humor, or perhaps it was coincidence, but the bane of low-level players became the first floor's labyrinth guardian. Old-timers still swap stories of the "Swine God" who allegedly commanded lesser boars across the plains.

**NPC Behavior**: Floor 1 NPCs are hardworking and rarely idle. They run shops and inns in the Town of Beginnings and are warm and welcoming. However, rogue NPCs do exist who help orange (criminal) players hide in the cities.

**Transportation**: Horse-drawn carriages (protected, 6 players) and lone horses (unprotected, 2 players) available from main settlements.

## Gameplay Impact

- Floor 1 now offers a richer, more authentic SAO experience
- The 20-floor labyrinth provides a proper dungeon crawl challenge
- Iconic NPCs like Argo and Agil are available for quests
- Field boss encounters (Grath) add rare, exciting challenges
- Multiple quest types encourage diverse gameplay (combat, gathering, exploration)

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add transportation system between settlements
- Implement Tolbana's amphitheater for duels
- Create "orange player" hideout mechanics
- Add seasonal changes to forest areas
- Implement the Fountain Square gathering area
- Add more Secret Medicine quest variants
