This document describes the three newly implemented features that enhance the UX, visual clarity, and RPG identity of the game.

## 2. Animated Combat Log (#1)

**Purpose**: Make the combat log more engaging and easier to parse with visual feedback and type-specific styling.

### Features
- **Type-specific styling**: Each log entry type gets a unique colored accent bar:
  - **Attack** (‚öîÔ∏è): Blue accent (`#4fc3f7`)
  - **Heal** (ü©π): Green accent (`#66bb6a`)
  - **Gold** (üí∞): Yellow accent (`#ffd54f`)
  - **Quest** (üìú): Purple accent (`#ba68c8`)
  - **Loot** (üéÅ): Light green accent (`#81c784`)
  - **Boss** (üëë): Red accent (`#ef5350`)
  - **Info** (‚ÑπÔ∏è): White accent (subtle)
- **Entrance animation**: Each new log entry fades in and slides up smoothly (260ms)
- **Automatic trimming**: Log keeps only the last 120 entries for performance
- **Enhanced readability**: Colored left borders and subtle backgrounds make scanning easier

### Implementation Details
- **Functions**:
  - `log(text, cls, type)`: Enhanced to accept a `type` parameter for styling
  - `logEvent(type, message, detail, cls)`: Now passes type to `log()` for CSS classes
  - `trimLog(max)`: Removes oldest entries when limit exceeded
- **CSS**:
  - `.log-line` base styles with fade-in animation (`logEnter`)
  - `.log-attack`, `.log-heal`, `.log-gold`, etc. for type-specific borders
  - Smooth opacity and transform transitions

### User Experience

- **UI display**: Shows "Archetype: [Name]" in player status panel

### Implementation Details
- **Data Structure**: `ARCHETYPES` object with 4 archetype definitions
  - Each contains: `id`, `name`, `desc`, `mods` (stat adjustments), `passives` (special bonuses)
- **Player Property**: `player.archetype` stores chosen archetype ID (null by default)
- **Modal Function**: `showArchetypeModal()` presents choices and applies selection
- **Combat Integration**:
  - `attackAction()`: Adds `ARCHETYPES.striker.passives.critBonus` to crit chance
  - `enemyTurn()`: 
    - Adds `ARCHETYPES.rogue.passives.dodgeBonus` to dodge chance
    - Subtracts `ARCHETYPES.guardian.passives.flatDamageReduction` from damage
