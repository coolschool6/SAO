# Floor 2: Urbus - Lore Integration

## Overview
Floor 2 of Aincrad has been updated with authentic SAO lore. This mountainous floor is nearly ten kilometers in diameter, featuring lush plateaus, tablelands, and mesas connected by rivers. The wilder areas are overrun by giant insects, and the floor culminates in the legendary Spiral Mountain labyrinth.

## Key Features Implemented

### Geography & Terrain
- **Table-top Mountains**: Chain of mountains covered with tall pine forests
- **Tablelands**: Large flatland areas atop high cliffs, arid and rocky with sparse vegetation
- **River Systems**: Countless rivers of varying sizes cutting through plateaus and valleys
- **Pine Forests**: Define large valleys and open plains near rivers
- **Spiral Mountain**: Created by rolling giant armadillidiidae, houses the labyrinth

### Settlements

#### Main Settlement: Urbus
- 300-meter wide city on a butte surrounded by forest

#### Sub-Settlements

### Lore Notes

**The Crusher Legend**: NPCs attacked Armadelon before players arrived but were defeated by its impregnable defenses and crushing power. Local NPCs still don't believe players defeated it and remain in constant fear of "The Day of the Crusher" when it might destroy civilization.

**Social Hierarchy**: Wealthy NPCs rarely leave their palatial houses. Most NPCs are farmers or shopkeepers living subsistence lifestyles. Bandits and thieves are plentiful in poorer areas and isolated roads.

**Criminal Underbelly**: Orange-flagged players can hide in Urbus's back alleys. The Rusty Dagger is a known rogue hangout. Rex the tavern owner maintains order but serves criminals as long as they behave.

**Flora Festival**: Annual spring event at High Fields of Crossing where players can rent spaces. The mountaintop is peaceful and safe despite lack of guard presence.

## Gameplay Impact

### New Mechanics
- **Sound-based aggro system** in labyrinth encourages tactical play
- **Environmental hazards**: Fall damage in tablelands and cliffs
- **Two labyrinth routes** offer player choice (risk vs. safety)
- **Stronger tableland monsters** provide high-risk, high-reward farming

### Challenge Progression
- Giant insect theme provides unique enemy variety
- Armadelon's high DEF (5) requires players to build ATK stats
- 15-floor labyrinth is longer than Floor 1's 20 floors but more linear
- Bandit enemies add human-type combat variety

### Exploration Rewards
- Crystal Cave mining for resources
- Safe zones without guards (High Fields) create interesting PvP dynamics
- Hidden passage in Urbus rewards exploration
- Flora Festival location offers social gathering space

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add Flora Festival seasonal event with special rewards
- Create orange player hideout quests in Rusty Dagger
- Implement toll-based lift system for mountain climbing
- Add event rental system for High Fields of Crossing
- Create "Day of the Crusher" fear mechanic for NPCs
- Implement dual-route choice for Spiral Mountain ascent
- Add fall damage mechanics for cliff areas
