# SAO Text Adventure - V1 Production Readiness

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0 (Production Ready)  
**Status**: âœ… All critical features implemented and hardened

---

## Completed Implementations

### 1. âœ… Save/Versioning System
**Implementation**:
- Added `SAVE_VERSION = 2` constant to track save schema
- Created `migrateSaveData()` function for forward-compatible save migrations
- Enhanced `load()` with try/catch around `JSON.parse()` for corrupt save handling
- All saves now include `version` field and migrate on load
- Graceful fallback to fresh state if migration fails

**Benefits**:
- Old saves load safely with sensible defaults
- Future schema changes won't break existing saves
- Robust error handling prevents data loss

---

### 2. âœ… Auto-Scroll Enhancement
**Implementation**:
- Verified `log()` function auto-scrolls `#log-entries` container
- Added ARIA live region attributes to `#log-entries`: `role="log" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="false"`
- Dual-scroll implementation: scrolls both log container and adventure-log wrapper

**Benefits**:
- Screen readers announce new log entries
- Newest content always visible on mobile
- Improved accessibility compliance

---

### 3. âœ… Combat Button State Management
**Implementation**:
- Added `setNonCombatControlsDisabled(disabled)` to disable field/town buttons during combat
- Added `setCombatButtonsEnabled(enabled)` to lock/unlock combat actions per turn
- Enhanced `enterCombat()` to disable non-combat controls
- Enhanced `combatTurn()` and `enemyTurn()` to toggle button states based on turn ownership
- `exitCombat()` re-enables all non-combat controls

**Benefits**:
- Prevents accidental navigation during combat
- Enforces turn-based action flow
- Eliminates button-spam exploits
- Clear visual feedback for whose turn it is

### 4. âœ… Market/Blacksmith Duplicate Guards
**Implementation**:
- **Market Buy**: Added name-based duplicate check for equipment purchases
- **Market Sell**: Double-guard to prevent selling equipped items
- **Blacksmith Costs**: Increased upgrade costs (200g + 2 materials for weapons, 180g + 2 materials for armor)
- Equipment upgrade tracker added for achievements

**Benefits**:
- Players can't buy duplicate gear by name
- Prevents accidental sale of equipped items
- More expensive upgrades balance economy

### 5. âœ… Quest Tracker - Top 3 Pinned
**Implementation**:
- Modified `updateQuestTracker()` to render only first 3 active quests
- Completed quests shown first (priority display)
- Added "+X more quest(s)" hint with clickable link to Quest Log
- Hint opens `#quests-mobile` details panel and scrolls into view

**Benefits**:
- Reduces UI clutter on mobile
- Prioritizes completed quests for collection
- Encourages use of full Quest Log for detailed view
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 6. âœ… Error Guards & DOM Safety
**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `showModal()` with null checks on `titleEl`, `body`, `actionsEl`
- Guarded `actions` array with default empty array
- Added null check to load() JSON.parse with recovery message
- All DOM queries wrapped with null guards where previously missing

**Benefits**:
- No crashes from missing DOM elements
- Graceful degradation if HTML structure changes
- Better error messages for debugging
- Production-safe modal system

---

### 7. âœ… Balance Pass
**Implementation**:

#### XP Curve (Tighter)
- Old: `50 + floor(50 * (level-1) * 1.2)`
- New: `50 + floor(60 * (level-1) * 1.3)`
- **Effect**: Slows leveling by ~15-20% at higher levels

#### Skill Point Rarity
- Old: Every level
- New: Every 3 levels
- **Effect**: Makes skill choices more meaningful and strategic

#### Boss HP Scaling
- Old: `hpMul * 10`
- New: `hpMul * 12`
- **Effect**: +20% boss HP for increased challenge

#### Drop Rates (Lower)
- Old: 50% base + luck/archetype bonuses
- New: 35% base + luck/archetype bonuses
- **Effect**: Resources more scarce, encourages market use

#### Sell Ratio (Tighter)
- Old: 1/4 of buy price (~25%)
- New: 1/5 of buy price (20%)
- **Effect**: Harder to profit from item flipping

#### Blacksmith Costs (Higher)
- **Weapon Upgrade**: 150g + 1 material â†’ **200g + 2 materials**
- **Armor Fortify**: 140g + 1 material â†’ **180g + 2 materials**
- **Effect**: Upgrades more expensive, material sinks added

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Phase 2 Priorities (Post-V1)
1. **Desktop Layout**: Re-enable 2-column layout for tablets/desktop (currently hidden)
2. **More Floors**: Expand beyond Floor 10 with unique themes
3. **Multiplayer/Co-op**: Consider async co-op dungeons
4. **Advanced Skills**: Skill trees and combo skills
5. **Achievements Page**: Dedicated UI for achievement browsing

### Non-Critical Issues
- No server-side persistence (client-only localStorage)
- No save slots (single save per browser)
- No undo/respec for archetype or stat allocation
- Limited enemy variety per floor (3-4 types)
