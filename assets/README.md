## 🎨 Adding Character Images

### The Game Works Without Images!
The battle screen uses **emoji placeholders** by default and automatically switches to real images when they're available. You don't need to add images right away!

### When You're Ready to Add Images:

1. **Find or create character artwork** (see `docs/CHARACTER_IMAGE_GUIDE.md` for tips)
2. **Add to this folder**:
   - Player character: `player_kirito.png`
   - Enemy characters: `enemies/[enemy_name].png`
3. **Refresh the game** - images load automatically!

### Image Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: 400-800px width, 600-1200px height
- **Style**: Full-body anime character art
- **File Size**: Under 500KB recommended

## 📖 Full Guide

For detailed instructions on creating, finding, and adding character images, see:

## ✨ Current Status

Currently using **emoji placeholders** - the game looks great and works perfectly!

Add character images when you want to enhance the visual experience even further.
